##  Libraries used


- **expo** â€“ Easy setup, navigation, and icons  
- **react-native-paper** â€“ UI components with modern design  
- **lucide-react-native** â€“ Icons  
- **react-native-flash-message** â€“ Toast messages for feedback  
- **react-native-reanimated** â€“ Simple animations  

##  Approach

Even for small apps, I prefer a modular, scalable structure that makes the code easy to understand, maintain, and extend.  

- Built with **Expo** using **TypeScript**
- Started with basic folder and file setup
- Implemented core features and user flow
- Added UI polish using libraries for a clean, modern feel
